### Why QGIS?

Why not? 

#### What data formats does QMap support?

Anything QGIS supports QMap does as well. QMap is just QGIS with a interface that is easier to use for field based data collection.

### Does QMap support online or offline maps?

Both.  QMap is just QGIS. If you would like a fully offline system you can just have local files, local SpataiLite, local PostGIS/MS SQL 2008+ install, etc.  If you want a online system with a WMS base just create a project with a WMS layer. 

### What about forms. Will QMap auto generate forms for me?

Currently no.  Forms must be built with Qt Designer (installed with qt4-deval from OSGeo4W).
